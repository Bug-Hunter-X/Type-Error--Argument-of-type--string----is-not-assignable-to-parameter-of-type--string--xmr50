This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array of strings to a function expecting a single string. The 'bug.ts' file shows the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.ts' provides a corrected version.  The error is specifically a type mismatch, causing TypeScript to throw an error during compilation.  Understanding this is key to effective TypeScript development.
